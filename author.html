                    The author of the series uses a pen name and has chosen to maintain anonymity by not disclosing
                    their gender. To represent themselves in public announcements related to the series, the author uses
                    an avatar of an alligator wearing glasses, which has become their distinctive symbol. While the
                    author, under the pen name Gotoge, has not personally revealed their gender for privacy reasons, it
                    was revealed by a Weekly Shonen Jump employee that the author is a woman. Kohei Ohnishi, an
                    editor at Weekly Shonen Jump, has also said that the writer’s personality shines through the series,
                    in particular in Tanjiro Kamado’s “serious nature, honesty, and strong sense of responsibility.”

                    Gotoge was born in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, on May 5, 1989.<br><br>

                    At the age of 24, Gotoge participated in the 70th Jump Treasure Newcomer Manga Awards in 2013 with
                    the work Kagarigari (過か狩がり狩がり). Kagarigari is a 45-page Demon-Slaying manga.<br><br>

                    The next year, 2014, they published their debut in the Jump Next 2014 vol.2 issue, with a 45 page
                    oneshot titled Monju Shiro Kyodai (文殊もんじゅ史しろ郎う兄きょう弟だい). Later that year, they
                    created a new 46 page oneshot titled Rokkotsu-san (肋ろっ骨こつさん), published in Weekly
                    Shonen Jump 2014-39 issue. The one-shot was part of Jump's Golden Future Cup as entry #3. <br><br>

                    The following year, 2015, Gotoge created a new 47 pages oneshot Haeniwa no Zigzag (蠅はえ庭にわのジグザグ), published again in Weekly Shonen Jump 2015-21 issue. The story is about
                    Zigzag, who has a mysterious power to remove curses. <br><br>

                    In 2016, Gotoge started their first serialization with Kimetsu no Yaiba (鬼き滅めつのの刃やいば), in Weekly Shonen Jump 2016-11 issue. Kimetsu no Yaiba is a Demon-slaying manga loosely
                    based on their first work Kagarigari. The series ended at 205 chapters on May 17th 2020 in issue
                    2020-24. It became a success, with over 150 million copies in circulation (including digital copies)
                    as of February 2021, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. <br><br>

                    In February 2021, Gotoge commented that their next project will be a science fiction romantic comedy
                    story. In the same month, Gotoge was honored as "Phenoms" in Time's annual list of 100 Most
                    Influential People, becoming the first manga artist to receive the achievement.
