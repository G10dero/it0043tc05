                <h2>Musical Score Technique</h2>
                <p class="author">Posted by Uzui's 7th Wife</p>
                <img src="./imgs/tengen-gif.gif">
                <p>As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tengen Uzui is a very powerful and skilled combatant. He has
                    displayed incredible physical feats of strength and speed, being seen as the second physically
                    strongest and the fastest runner out of the Taisho era's Hashira. He could match the combat
                    proficiency of both Daki and Gyutaro, both Upper Rank demons that have fought and killed numerous
                    Hashira in the past. Tengen was also able to effortlessly decapitate Daki without her realizing
                    it, to the point that he didn't see her as an Upper Rank demon at all.<br><br>

                    One of the reasons why he can fend off an Upper Rank Demon is because of the technique he developed
                    called Musical Score (譜ふ面めん ). Tengen developed this technique using his heightened sense of hearing
                    to work in conjunction
                    with his Sound Breathing, where he analyzes combat maneuvers and deconstructs the rhythm of his
                    enemies' attacks into sound, reading them like sheet music to the point every fight becomes like a
                    song. This allows Tengen to gain an understanding of his opponent's habits and tactics, as well as
                    their blind spots, giving him the edge against them. While it takes a long time for Tengen to
                    construct the score, once completed, Tengen was able to fight Gyutaro on even terms despite having
                    lost his left hand, but due to the poison he was pushed to the limit and was unable to strike at the
                    Upper Rank's neck.

                <h2>What is the Significance of Blue Spider Lily in the Story's Plot?</h2>
                <p class="author">Posted by Boltchu</p>
                <img src="./imgs/spider-lily.gif">
                <p> For context, I have just finished the Demon Slayer manga and I truly believe that there was no point
                    in adding the blue spider Lily flower to the story. The blue spider Lily was introduced when we knew
                    Muzan wanted to find it for a cure for his weakness to sunlight and he couldn't. We later learn that
                    he specifically is looking for it because the doctor who gave him the treatment used the flower. But
                    was there any point in using this flower for the plot? Wouldn't we have ended up at the exact same
                    conclusion to the story? If we supposedly never specified that the doctor used the flower, then
                    Muzan would have just be looking for a cure and not anything specific, right? Nezuko will still be
                    turned into a demon since he turned he because he was looking for a demon immune to sunlight and the
                    entirety of the story would have still unfolded. Please let me know if I am wrong about this because
                    a friend is debating me on this and has no evidence, so I am seeing if in a sea of people more
                    knowledgeable in the events of demon slayer than either of us, can prove my thinking wrong.
